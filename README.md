### Abstract

Human action recognition has always been one of the most active research fields, especially with the recent devel- opments of Deep Learning. In this paper, we present a vari- ety of models to detect coughing and sneezing motions from video data. Previous work exists in this subject area, but is limited and not based on deep learning approaches. Here we first explored two baseline models: CNN + LSTM model and 3D-Conv model. These two baseline models per- form worse than the previous work, which attained a test ac- curacy of 44.4%. Then we improved the first baseline model to two more advanced models: VGG-16 Features + LSTM model and HRNet Features + LSTM network model. Fi- nally, we investigated if adding an Attention layer after the LSTM layer helps improve the models. Our best-performing model outperforms the previous work significantly, achiev- ing a test accuracy of 83.5%.
